abstract: "This paper considers individual-level credit responses after the implementation of work requirements for SNAP benefits. It does so by exploiting county-level variation in the reintroduction of work requirements after the Great Recession. We find that new SNAP work requirements lead more people to seek out new credit and lead to an increase in credit account openings. New work requirements also result in an increase in total outstanding credit balances as well as an increase in past due balances. These findings suggest that individuals are turning to credit and debt products to cover expenses after losing SNAP eligibility."
