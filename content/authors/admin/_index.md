I am a PhD Candidate at Cornell University in the Department of Policy Analysis and Management and a Visiting Scholar at the Federal Reserve Board. My research focuses on applied work in the economics of labor market institutions and worker compensation, education and skill development, public finance, and urban economics. I also have research that focuses on applied demography and consumer finance. Before coming to Cornell, I was a Senior Research Assistant at the Federal Reserve Board Consumer and Community Development Research section.
