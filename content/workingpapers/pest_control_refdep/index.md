abstract: "People often set goals that they fail to meet. One intuitive way of addressing this is to evaluate one's progress in smaller components. Theory suggests this should reveal reference-dependent preferences and loss aversion. This paper uses novel data from a sales company to test for reference-dependent daily labor supply as a commitment device to offset present bias for achieving longer-run goals. I show that daily labor supply shifts downward at a workerâ€™s expectations. Daily expectations are selected by workers based on long-run objectives around the bonuses paid by the firm at the end of the sales season. After surpassing their bonus threshold, workers reduce their hours from what was a consistent labor supply in their prior personal equilibrium, consistent with the bonus being the impetus behind daily reference dependence. An online real-effort experiment further supports the idea that short-run reference dependence can be "made" through a firm's compensation scheme. The experiment implies that this leads to greater firm profitability."

summary: Updated, 2023. Workers exhibit reference-dependent labor supply around expectations. Their expectations are based upon optimizing long-run objectives at lump-sum bonuses paid by the firm.
