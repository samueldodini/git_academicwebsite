abstract: This paper measures the effects of subsidies in the Affordable Care Act on adverse financial outcomes using administrative tax data and financial outcomes from credit data. Using a difference-in-differences design with propensity score stratification, I find that at $100 per capita, ACA premium tax credits reduced the rate of severe mortgage delinquency by 4%, consumer bankruptcies by 13%, and the rate of severe auto delinquency by 13%. The subsidies reduced the right tail of the debt distribution, including debts in third-party collections. The benefits of the tax credits accrue to a variety of economic actors. The value of the risk protections to recipients against medical debt amounts to approximately 10-15% of the cash costs of the credits, while the subsidies provided substantial indirect transfers to external parties totaling approximately two-thirds of the program's costs.

summary: The tax credits in the Affordable Care Act substantially reduce bankruptcy, and severely delinquent debt. Welfare gains for protection against medical debt accounts for 15% of program costs, while indirect transfers to creditors, lenders, and hospitals account for almost 2/3 of the costs.
