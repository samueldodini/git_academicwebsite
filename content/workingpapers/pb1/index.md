abstract: "Sociological scholarship has been central to advancing our understanding of durable
neighborhood disadvantage, but less attention has been devoted to analyzing efforts to alleviate
such conditions. In this paper, we assess the growth and unequal geography of federal place-
based policies designed to combat concentrated neighborhood disadvantage. We develop a novel
longitudinal dataset of federal place-based policies from 1990 to 2015 and find evidence of a
substantial increase in funding over that period. Federal funding for disadvantaged places now
rivals or outpaces the funding allocated to many federal programs for disadvantaged people.
Federal place-based policies are national in their reach, but they are also distributed unequally
across neighborhoods. We draw on sociological theory to connect the uneven geographic reach
of federal place-based policies to the economic, institutional, and socio-political organization of
local communities. We find that federal place-based policy was implemented with greater
intensity in counties with more disadvantaged populations, higher levels of economic and racial
segregation, a greater density of nonprofit organizations, and tighter housing markets. We close
by discussing the implications of the place-based turn in federal policymaking for spatial
inequality and social policy."

summary: The federal government spent over $360 billion from 1990-2015 on place-based policies. Areas with more disadvantage, more segregation, and more non-profit capacity received more of these funds.
